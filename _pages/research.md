  - title: "Research"
    excerpt: "My research is aimed at developing techniques from both **nonlinear control theory** and **machine learning** to systematically achieve stable and robust robotic-assisted locomotion and to easily translate these behaviors to clinical settings. Thus, my research can be separated into three general topics: *Bipedal Locomotion*, *Human Robot Interaction*, and *Lower-Body Assistive Devices*. 
    For more detailed information about my research please reference the full papers on my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mgQTjk0AAAAJ&hl=en)"
