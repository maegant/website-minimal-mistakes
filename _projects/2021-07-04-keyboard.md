## Custom TKL Mechanical Keyboard
Over the pandemic, I spent my additional free time towards developing a custom TKL mechanical keyboard from scratch. 

### PCB Design
I wasn't able to find a reasonable TKL PCB with programmable RGB LEDs for each key, so I designed my own. I starting with the open-source layout [XMMX](https://easyeda.com/farmakon/XMMX-0447d28c1e4644b88fd04905d983684d), and modified it to include RGB LEDS (WS2812B) for each key. You can find the PCB layout on EasyEDA as [LED XMMX](https://oshwlab.com/mtucker/led-xmmx)

### Case Design
I also wasn't able to find an affordable PCB case, so I also designed my own that I laser cut out of acrylic. The SVG files are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/h4rvcedpb1ry24x/AACOMv3k4c0gsGpH-WfcjVkea?dl=0). I also included the PCB plate in the laser cut pieces.

### Parts
I spent a large amount of time (arguably too long) sourcing my switches and keycaps. So in case you are interested, I will list the parts I bought here. Note that the prices do not include shipping.

### Firmware
I flashed my keyboard using [QMK Firmware](https://qmk.fm/). There already existed a XMMX configuration on the [public repository](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/xmmx), but because I added the LEDS to my keyboard, I needed to write a new configuration. I named this new keyboard led_xmmx, and wrote the new firmware which you can find in a [separate repository](https://github.com/maegant/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/xmmx_led).
