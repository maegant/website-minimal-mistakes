Under the guidance of Dr. Pucha, I contributed to creating and verifying a MATLAB code that analytically creates a Carbon Nanotube Matrix and uses various known nanocomposite properties to calculate the material resistance and capacitance of the randomly generated sample. The diagram of the code can be seen below.
Over the course of a summer semester, I modified the code to correctly calculate the electrical capacitance of the CNT matricies as well as fix errors in the code logic. The comparison of the old and new code outputs can be seen below.
