Over the past several years, I've purchased and assembled the following keyboards.

### Lily58 Pro

I chose to purchase the [Lily58](https://keyhive.xyz/shop/lily58) PCB kit because it is relatively inexpensive and has a unique layout. Specifically, I purchased the through-hole version because I wanted individual LEDS for each key. Although in hindsight, I probably would buy the hotswap version instead. To assemble the keyboard, I followed this [build guide](https://github.com/Keycapsss/Lily58L-Build-Guide/blob/master/buildguide_en.md).

All purchased items:
- Keyboard PCB and plates ([$25](https://keyhive.xyz/shop/lily58)) 
- 2 Pro Micros ([$15](https://keyhive.xyz/shop/pro-micro))
- 65 Brown Gateron Switchs ([$18](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/2255800821908641.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.0.0.2c351802cBxvIj&gatewayAdapt=4itemAdapt))
- 2 OLED LCD Display Modules ([$8](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/2251832779154549.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.0.0.2c351802cBxvIj&gatewayAdapt=4itemAdapt))
- 58 SMD Diodes ([$2.50](https://keyhive.xyz/shop/diodes))

### Gopolar Tai-Chi GG86 Keyboard
I purchased the [GG86](https://kono.store/products/gopolar-tai-chi-gg86-mechanical-keyboard) keyboard mostly to cheer myself up after a particularly tough month of work. But the huge benefit in purchasing this keyboard is witnessing what high-end mechanical keyboards look like. This thing is no joke!

All purchased items:
- Keyboard and case ($149): Link above
- 100 Cherry MX Red RGB Clear PCB Mount Switches ([$49](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=4449)) 
- Ducky 'Frozen Llama' Keycap Set ([$49](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=5270))
